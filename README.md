# Web Dev Final Project

## Project Spec

The general theme of this project is a simplified clone of the browser-based game, slither.io. The game will run in the browser and allow users to control a snake-like character. The goal is to have the longest snake. The user will be able to create a username and play. They will have to avoid moving circular obstacles and consume energy dots that increase the length of their snake. They can also submit their score to the leaderboard, where top scores will be displayed. The target audience for this game can be anyone that wants to play (general public)! I anticipate this game being the most popular with children and teens. This application will manage the username, score, leaderboard data (username and score), and top score. The user will submit their username at the beginning of the game and if they have played multiple games in a row their top score will appear. While playing, a leaderboard will appear in the upper right corner with the current 10 top scores that are still "alive". The user will also be able to view a list of top scores from the landing page displaying the highest scores ever obtained and user information associated with those scores.

Some stretch goals for this project include moving snake obstacles and color customization. If I can get my project fully functional as intended, I want to generate moving snake obstacles, similar to the actual slither.io game. While multiplayer would be hard to support within the scope of this project, I want the user to feel like they aren't playing with an easy bot. I also think it would be cool to add a difficulty level that affects how many "obstacles" there are and how fast the snake moves. If possible I also want to implement the speed increase when the user holds down their mouse. I think it would be cool to allow users to change the color of their snake before they start playing. I also think it would be cool to add a fun snake animation on the highest scores of all time list with the color/type of snake the user used when playing.

I am very excited to get started on this project. I forsee a main challenge being the animation. I think the backend work will be difficult, but doable, however, my attention to detail is going to make me frustrated if I cannot get the snakes to look like how they do in the actual game. I also forsee the bot snakes being a challenge (if I have time to implement them). I want them to move how other users would, but that is difficult to do  when there aren't actually people playing as them. I want to game to be fun but I am worried it will be too boring if I cannot get the animation or bot obstacles to behave properly. While I have these concerns, I think this project sounds like a fun challenge and I am very excited to get started.
